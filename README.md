<h1><b>Intelligent Training And Placement Automation System for Higher Education Institution</b></h1>

<p>  One of the biggest challenges higher education institutions confront today is improving students’ placement performance. The conventional training and placement system lacks the tools necessary to predict students’ performance and notify students of placement events effectively. Manual processing of students' data is ineffective, time-consuming, and prone to human errors. It is an interactive software platform focusing on student data management and analysis to digitize practices. It provides insights on all students to the placement team with the help of data mining and machine learning techniques. It also provides a platform for employers to streamline the hiring process. Students can keep track of their placement process easily with the help of the placement calendar. Those who qualify for the process will receive notifications via email or SMS with information about the company, date, and time of the interview/test.</p>
<h2> PROPOSED SYSTEM</h2>
<p>The proposed system aims to automate the entire placement process and to analyze students' performance. The system gathers and stores all the students’ data in a database, through which students can register with companies with a single click of a button. Hiring teams can automatically generate eligibility list, shortlist candidates and post it in students’ feeds. The information acquired is presented in the form of trend graphs and statistics, which can be used by the placement cell to understand better where the students stand. Students can keep track of their placement events and activities with the help of the placement calendar.</p>
<h2> SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE </h2>
<p>The overall system is designed as a three-tier architecture, which separates applications into three logical and physical computing tiers as depicted in Figure 3.1. The three tiers are the presentation tier, application tier, and data tier. The presentation tier is the user interface where the end user interacts with the application. The presentation tier runs on the web browser as a web application. The application tier is where the logic of the application is written. This layer has five modules namely the master dataset module, resume builder, performance analyzer, placement calendar, and hiring process module, where the information is processed and collected either from the data tier.</p>
